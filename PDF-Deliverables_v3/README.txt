# INSTALLATION

-- download and install current Node client (npm)
-- clone repo
-- open repo in command line and cd into project root directory "/g4"
-- run command "npm install" to install all dependencies
-- run command "npm run dev" to run local dev server
-- open web browser to localhost:3000 (a link will come up in the terminal, 3000 is the default port for the node server)

# DEPENDENCIES
-- JS Framework: Vite
-- Testing Framework: Vitest (in-built)
-- Coverage: Instanbulv8
-- project dependency handler: npm (node package manager)

# Strengths:

-- Easy vs Hard mode selecting, the intelligence of the predictive move algorithm
(on hard mode) reall can present a challenge for the player

-- Efficiency : since this project is built on js, its run time is compact and quick, once
the project is running... it is responsive and doesn't take much time at all to "think"

# Weaknesses:

-- the only apparent weakness is in the coverage, due to the complex nature of the UI 
framework vite, there is many inbuilt structures that are difficult to test, such as how 
the DOM is actually delivered to the server through vite.
